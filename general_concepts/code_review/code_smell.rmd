"Code smell" is a term used in software development to describe any characteristic in the source code that could indicate a deeper problem. Just like bad smells in the real world alert us to something potentially unpleasant, code smells are indicators that there might be issues with the design or structure of the code.

Code smells don't necessarily mean there is a bug, but they suggest areas of the code that might be difficult to maintain, extend, or understand in the future. Identifying and addressing code smells can improve the overall quality of the codebase.

Here are some common examples of code smells:

1. **Duplicate Code:**
   - Identical or very similar code found in more than one place in the codebase.

2. **Long Method:**
   - A method or function that is excessively long, making it hard to understand and maintain.

3. **Large Class:**
   - A class that does a lot of things or has too many responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

4. **Feature Envy:**
   - A method that seems more interested in a class other than the one it is in, indicating a possible need to move the method to another class.

5. **Primitive Obsession:**
   - Using primitive data types for complex tasks instead of creating dedicated classes, making the code less expressive and harder to maintain.

6. **Data Clumps:**
   - When the same group of variables is passed around together in multiple methods or classes, suggesting they should be bundled into a class.

7. **Switch Statements:**
   - Using switch or if-else statements excessively, which can indicate a lack of polymorphism and violate the Open/Closed Principle.

8. **Lazy Class:**
   - A class that doesn't do enough to justify its existence and could be merged with another class or eliminated.

9. **Comments:**
   - Excessive comments can sometimes indicate that the code is not self-explanatory and might need refactoring to be more readable.

10. **Refused Bequest:**
    - A subclass that doesnâ€™t use the methods or data members inherited from its parent class, indicating a flawed inheritance hierarchy.

11. **Inappropriate Intimacy:**
    - Classes that are tightly coupled or have too much knowledge about each other, leading to maintenance challenges when one class changes.

Recognizing these smells is subjective and often requires experience. Various tools and static analyzers exist to help developers identify code smells in their codebases. Once a code smell is identified, refactoring the code to address the issue is usually the recommended course of action to improve the overall quality and maintainability of the software.
